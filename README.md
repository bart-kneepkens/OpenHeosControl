# OpenHeosControl

OpenHeosControl is a lightweight desktop application to control HEOS sound systems around your home.

HEOS (or Denon) has not released any controller software for desktop machines; the mobile apps are the only option users have.
Since Denon does not feel obliged to supply such software with their >â‚¬250 sound systems, I guess I'll do it myself.

# Version 0.1 : Barebone
Version 0.1 of OpenHeosControl only contains minimum functionality. Users can play, pause and stop the music on their HEOS system, as well as change the volume from a (not so friendly yet ðŸ¤”) UI.

HEOS systems can not be automatically discovered yet. It needs to be connected to by IP address.
